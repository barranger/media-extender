MediaExtender
--------------

A chrome extension that adds inline media to your [App.Net](https://alpha.app.net) timeline.

Status
------

Currently it only supports:

* jpeg/gif/png images
* facebook
* instagram
* imgur
* twitter

Short Term TODOs
----------------

* Improve the ui/ux of the inlined media (perhaps a show/hide toggle)
* Add more Media Types
* Add an options page to turn the processors on and off individually

Installation 
------------
1. Download the [Zip file](https://github.com/barranger/media-extender/zipball/master) and unpack it.
2. In Chrome, visit chrome://extensions and check "Development mode".
3. Click on "Load unpacked extension..." and select the folder where you unpacked the extension.
4. Browse App.Net

Feedback
--------
Any comments/complaints/media suggestions should be directed to [@barranger](https://alpha.app.net/barranger) on App.Net
