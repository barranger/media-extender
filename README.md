media-extender
==============

A chrome extension that adds inline media to your [App.Net](https://alpha.app.net) timeline.

Currently it only supports:

* jpeg/gif/png images
* facebook
* instagram

The short-term todo list looks like this:

* Use mustache for the templating
* Refactor processors to make it easier to add new processors
* Improve the ui/ux of the inlined media (perhaps a show/hide toggle)

**NOTE:** when starting out this project I borrowed (read: shamelessly stole :) ) code from [SnappShot](https://github.com/johncarney/snappshot). Thanks John!
